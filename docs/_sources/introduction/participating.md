# Participating

Every contribution is welcome to {{col}}.
Please have a look at several ways in which you can contribute to the project.

* Find bugs in the code and create pull requests.
* Improving the documentation and the tutorials.
* Contributing with novel (also experimental) measures of hardness.
* Proposing new features and, if possible, implementing them.
* Discussing novel environment selection procedures based on the measures of hardness.
* Take part in the development objectives listed below.

A [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/JBEezJgxGY) has been set up and everyone is welcome to join it, whether for a quick chat or for a long discussion.

## Current objectives

**Implementations**
- Implement additional MDPs.
- Improve the efficiency of the MDP creation-related code.
- Implement additional tabular and non-tabular agents.

**Analysis**
- Implement an automatic pdf summary creation for the results of benchmarks.
- Implement tools to allow the use of custom hardness measures in the hardness analysis.
- Implement the possibility of creating custom hardness analysis scenarios.

**Performance indicators**
- Provide the sample complexity computation.
- Implement the discounted cumulative reward performance indicator.
