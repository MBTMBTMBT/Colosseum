# Installation

The {{col}} can be installed from the public {{repo_url}}.

We highly recommend to set up a virtual environment using Conda,
```
conda create --name colosseum
conda activate colosseum
pip install git+https://github.com/MichelangeloConserva/Colosseum
```
or Python virtual environments,
```
python3 -m venv colosseum
source colosseaum/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/MichelangeloConserva/Colosseum
```

Please note that {{col}} has been developed using Python 3.7.
If you find some incompatibility with later Python version, please raise an issue.
