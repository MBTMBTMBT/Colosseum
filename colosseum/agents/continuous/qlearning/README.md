The *Q-learning* agent with optimistic bonus for infinite horizon with discounted rewards MDPs is taken from [1].
A regret upper bound of `O(sp(V^∗)(SA)^{1/3} T^{2/3)` ignoring logarithmic terms for any weakly communicating MDP is given in [1].
`sp(V^∗)` is the span of the optimal state value function, `S` is the number of states, `A` is the number of action and `T` is the optimization time horizon.
