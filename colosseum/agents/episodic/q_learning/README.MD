The *Q-learning* agent with optimistic bonuses for episodic MDPs is taken from [1].
A high probability regret upper bound of `O(\sqrt{H^3SAT})` ignoring logarithmic terms is given in [1].
`H` is the episode length, `S` is the number of states, `A` is the number of action and `T` is the optimization time horizon.
