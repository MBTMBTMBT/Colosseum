The _SimpleGrid_ MDP is a grid world in which the agent can either choose to move in one of the cardinal
directions or stay in the same position.
At each time step, the agent is given a small reward.
Depending on the parameters of the MDP, some corner states yield a high reward and the others zero reward.
The starting states are selected from the center of the grid in order to be as far as possible from the corners.
